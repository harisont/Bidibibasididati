# Introduction

## KDD

We refer to the conversion of raw data into useful information/patterns with the acronym __KDD__ (Knowledge Discovery in Databases).
This process consists of three main steps:
1. __Input data preprocessing__: raw data is converted into a format appropriate for analysis (common preprocessing tasks examples: _feature selection_, _dimensionality reduction_, _normalization_ and _data subsetting_); 
2. Actual __data mining__ (the main data mining tasks will be discussed later on);
3. __Data postprocessing__, e.g. _filtering_, _visualization_ and _pattern interpretation_.
